          <p class=" badge badge-secondary">Aug 02, 2020 </p>
          <h5>by <b>Metaeducator</b></h5>
          <p>The healthcare system is facing an unprecedented crisis, but accurate COVID-19 coding and billing can help
            providers weather the storm and prepare for future outbreaks.</p>
          <hr>
          <img class="rounded " alt="COrona virus " style="height:auto; max-width:100%; border:none;
        display:block;" src="/static/homeimg/2020-03-02_coronavirus.jpg"></a>
          <br>
          <p><time datetime="2020-4-17">April 17, 2020</time> -&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic is putting strain on the
            healthcare system, but accurately capturing data and documenting cases of the novel coronavirus can help
            ease the burden on providers.</p>



          <p>COVID-19 coding and billing allows providers to track the spread of the novel coronavirus and get paid for
            testing and treating the sudden surge of patients presenting with symptoms of the highly contagious disease.
            And effective processes will help providers overcome the challenges of COVID-19 now and in the future.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Equipping a health care workforce to accurately code medical procedures, streamlines communication
            across the health system, reducing administrative and rework costs at a time when resources are stretched by
            the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo;says Patrice A. Harris, MD, MA, president of the American Medical Association
            (AMA).</p>

          <p>However, a lack of resources and oftentimes know-how is preventing many providers from realizing the
            benefits of effective COVID-19 coding and billing.</p>
          <p>It is not business as usual at this time. Many healthcare organizations have had to cancel or postpone
            their normal services to prevent the spread of COVID-19, while many more are now treating and having to
            document patients with a completely novel condition. Meanwhile, increasing unemployment rates are bringing
            in a new mix of patients to organizations, creating more coding and documentation challenges than usual.</p>

          <p>The healthcare industry is quickly adapting to world in which COVID-19 exists and that includes creating
            new codes for the novel coronavirus. Using these codes and new documentation guidelines that come with them
            will be critical to tackling COVID-19 and the challenges associated with it.</p>

          <p>In the following article, <em>RevCycleIntelligence </em>breaks down what providers need to know about
            COVID-19 coding and billing and best practices organizations can implement to ease the burden now and when
            the dust settles.</p>

          <h3><strong>New codes enable COVID-19 tracking and billing</strong></h3>

          <p>Providers use a variety of medical code sets to document and bill for patient encounters. The primary sets
            used by providers have all recently created new codes to capture COVID-19 testing and care.</p>

          <h3><strong><em>ICD-10-CM</em></strong></h3>

          <p>Spurred by the urgent need to capture COVID-19 diagnoses on claims and surveillance data, the CDC <a
              href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/Announcement-New-ICD-code-for-coronavirus-3-18-2020.pdf">announced</a>
            in March that is has added the new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
            Modification (ICD-10-CM) emergency code created by the World Health Organization earlier this year. The code
            to document the diagnosis of COVID-19 is U07.1, 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.</p>
          .</p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/COVID-19-guidelines-final.pdf">official
              guidance</a> from the CDC, providers should only use U07.1 to document a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19
            as documented by the provider, per documentation of a positive COVID-19 test result, or a presumptive
            positive COVID-19 test result. This also applies to asymptomatic patients who test positive for coronavirus.
          </p>

          <p>CDC notes that this is an exception to the hospital inpatient guideline. In this case,
            &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; does not require documentation of the type of test performed, rather provider
            documentation is sufficient.</p>

          <p>The new ICD-10-CM code is a principal or first-listed diagnosis code, so providers should sequence it first
            then use appropriate codes for associated manifestations, except in obstetric patients.</p>

          <p>CMS has also recognized the code for Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) Grouper purposes
            effective April 1, 2020 at which time the ICD-10 MS-DRG Grouper software package accommodated the new code.
          </p>
          <p>
          <p>Suspected, possible, probable, or inconclusive cases of COVID-19 should not be assigned U07.1, CDC
            emphasizes in the guidance. Instead, providers should assign codes explaining the reason for the encounter,
            such as a fever or Z20.828, Contact with and (suspected) exposure to other viral communicable diseases.</p>

          <p>Providers should also code for exposure to COVID-19 using code Z03.818, Encounter for observation for
            suspected exposure to other biological agents ruled out and screening, CDC states.</p>

          <h3><strong><em>CPT</em></strong></h3>

          <p>Since the COVID-19 outbreak, AMA has also been updating its Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set
            to enable providers to code and bill for coronavirus testing.</p>

          <p>AMA announced on March 13 the addition of CPT code 87635 for novel coronavirus testing through infectious
            agent detection by nucleic acid. The code should be used, for example, if a provider or other healthcare
            professional collects respiratory swabs and sends them to the lab after suspecting a 47-year-old male
            presenting to the emergency department with fever, cough, and shortness of breath has COVID-19.</p>

          <p>More recently, the association unveiled the addition of codes 86328 and 86769 for COVID-19 antibody tests
            and the revision for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests (86318).</p>

          <p>Code 86328 was created for antibody tests using a single step method immunoassay, AMA stated in the
            announcement. The testing method usually includes a strip with all of the critical components for the assay
            and is appropriate for a point-of care platform. Code 86769 was established for antibody tests using a
            multiple step method, the association reported.</p>

          <h3><em><strong>HCPCS</strong></em></h3>

          <p>As COVID-19 testing ramps up, CMS has created Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes so
            providers can get reimbursed for diagnosing patients and stopping the spread of coronavirus.</p>

          <img class="rounded " alt="COrona virus " style="height:auto; max-width:100%; border:none;
        display:block;" src="/static/homeimg/coding.jfif"></a>
          <br>

          <p>Earlier this year, CMS announced the addition of two codes &ndash; U0001 and U0002 &ndash; for COVID-19
            tests. The first code can be used to document and bill for tests performed specifically at CDC testing
            laboratories, while the second code supports the agency&rsquo;s efforts to allow clinical laboratories
            outside of the CDC to create and bill for their own COVID-19 tests.</p>

          <p>Medicare started accepting the codes on April 1, 2020, and the codes will be retroactive to account for
            testing done on or after Feb. 4, 2020.</p>

          <p>According to a pricing list from March 12, 2020, Medicare will reimburse providers about $35 for claims
            coded with U0001 and approximately $51 for claims with U0002.</p>

          <h3><strong>Telehealth coding and billing</strong></h3>

          <p>In addition to caring for patients with a novel virus, many providers are also engaging in unchartered
            territory: telehealth.</p>

          <p>Hospitals are using telehealth services when possible to triage patients, a recent report from the Office
            of the Inspector at HHS showed. Ambulatory organizations are following suit as elective and non-urgent
            services decline.</p>

          <p>But for many providers, telehealth is a new service emerging from the COVID-19 crisis and it is presenting
            new coding and billing challenges for organizations.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, HHS has relaxed a wide range of rules and regulations to enable providers to leverage
            telehealth during the crisis and get paid the same amount for treating patients virtually. Some of the
            services include telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits. The department also continues to add
            new services to the list as the crisis continues.</p>

          <p>To document telehealth services and other virtual visits, CMS has provided a <a
              href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">list of HCPCS
              codes</a> that will be paid for under the Physician Fee Schedule during the national emergency.</p>

          <p>AMA has also provided guidance on telehealth coding and billing using CPT codes. The guidance covers coding
            for telehealth visits, online digital visits, remote patient monitoring, and telephone evaluation and
            management services. The association&rsquo;s 11 scenarios for CPT coding during the crisis also includes
            examples of how to code for telehealth services.</p>

          <h3><strong>Best practices for COVID-19 coding and billing</strong></h3>

          <p>Rules and regulations are seemingly changing every day as new information emerges regarding COVID-19, and
            with that coding and billing policies shift to account for the latest information. With that in mind,
            providers need to be diligently following coding and billing guidance from the CDC, CMS, AMA, and other
            official organizations, says Maria Noelle Ward, MEd, RHIA, CCS, CCS-P, director of HIM practice excellence
            at AHIMA.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Most importantly, they need to be sure that they&#39;re following the coding guidelines, those
            provided from a visit perspective and the telehealth and the CPT codes, but also the guidelines that have
            been provided by the CDC for actually coding patients who have COVID,&rdquo; she told
            <em>RevCycleIntelligence</em>.</p>

          <p>This is especially important as hospitals shift services to outpatient in preparation for greater inpatient
            demand, Ward stressed.</p>

          <p>Providers should also be assessing documentation guidelines in their EHRs to make sure providers are
            accurately documenting services at this time. CDI query templates are a key resource for providers, Ward
            stated.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;All of the coded data is going to provide information that contributes to patient care, public
            policy, reimbursement determination, and any of the statistics related to the spread of COVID,&rdquo; Ward
            concluded. &ldquo;Researchers looking at how to treat this and future coronavirus outbreaks are going to
            need this information. So, it has to be correct on the front end.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;In order to do that, we have to have complete, precise, accurate documentation and it needs to
            reflect all of the related conditions. That&rsquo;s going to lead to higher quality data that will affect
            patient outcomes in the future.&rdquo;</p>
